## Introduction
In the ever-changing landscape of banking today, maintaining customer loyalty has become a crucial factor for the success of financial institutions. The ability to keep devoted customers has a direct impact on profitability, market share, and brand reputation. One key interaction point with customers is the Automated Teller Machine (ATM), which remains a fundamental channel for cash withdrawal and various banking transactions. Recognizing the significance of customer retention, we are initiating a transformative Business Intelligence and Data Analytics project. The goal is to explore data-driven strategies to optimize ATM performance, ultimately leading to improved customer retention. Through the utilization of data analytics, our objective is to uncover valuable insights that will enhance our understanding of customer behavior, boost operational efficiency, and foster enduring customer relationships.
